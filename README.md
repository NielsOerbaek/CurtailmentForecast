# Curtailment Forecast

#### _What is this?_

A forecast of how likely it is that curtailment of generators will be issued in the Orkney ANM. Like a weather forecast, but just with curtailment instead. It can be used to get an overview of the next few days, and the idea is to incoorperate this service with power hungry devices, to schedule the tasks for times where energy is in excess. Currently it is simply a demonstration of our models and hopefully it can help make the ANM curtailment system a little more understandable for the orcadians affected by it.

#### _How does it work?_

Through a bunch of data collection, we have created a (neural network-based) programmme that estimates curtailment based on wind speeds, day-of-week, and time-of-day. We then combine this model with the weather forecasts generated by the [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/forecast/gftcsumwq#?date=2019-05-15) to make forecasts of whether curtailment will happen a certain times in the future. The data for training the model have been collected through the [SSE's ANM website](https://www.ssen.co.uk/ANMGeneration/), and the wind speed data used have been generated by the ERE turbine on Eday.

#### _Who made this?_

This website is a by-product of a MSc-thesis project by [Niels Ørbæk Christensen](mailto:niec@itu.dk) at the IT University of Copenhagen, made in collaboration with the [Orkney Cloud](http://orkneycloud.org/) project, invisioning community-led data services in Orkney.

The author would like to give thanks to Andrew and Clive of Eday Renewable Energy Ltd, for allowing us to use the wind data from their turbine.
